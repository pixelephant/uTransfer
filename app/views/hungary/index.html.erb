				The Hungarian higher education has a long history. The first Hungarian university was found- ed in Pécs in south Hungary over 600 years ago, in 1367.
				Hungary has been taking part in the Bologna Process since 1999, whose most important goal is the creation of the European Higher Educa- tion Area. A two-cycle degree system has been introduced. The first degree programs (3 to 4 years) lead to Bachelor’s degrees, while sec- ond degree programmes (1 to 2 years) lead to Master’s degrees. Unified, undivided, long-term Master’s degree programmes (5 to 6 years) are offered in some fields of study, e.g. in human medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, veterinary medi- cine, architecture, law and in a few programmes of art education. All Bachelor’s and Master’s de- grees grant access to the labour market.</p>
