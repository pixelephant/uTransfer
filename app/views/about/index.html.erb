		<p>After finishing my studies in Hungary, I moved to the field of export and I worked for an international company or more than a year. That was the point when Peter and me figured out that we want to do something else. So we had founded uTransfer Europe Ltd. with the intention of <strong>creating a unique business</strong> which gives services to students.</p>
