			<h3>Visa procedure</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="box gray twothird">
			<p>uTransfer Europe helps students to be able <strong>to receive the visa needed for studying in Hungary</strong>, we provide you all the necessary information and some extra hints how to make sure to get the visa. We provide a unique service by having an authorization letter written by the student, which entitles us to act on behalf of the student if any sort of problem occurs during the procedure. We can solve the problems as long as the problem is from Hungarian point of view such as: University like problems, proof of accommodation. The reason why this is helpful is because <strong>the student does not have to go back to the Embassy a lot of times</strong>, just for submitting documents and students do not have to wait until he/she gets the official papers from Hungary again.
			<p><em>Please note that problems fall out of our scope have to be solved by the student.</em></p></p>
